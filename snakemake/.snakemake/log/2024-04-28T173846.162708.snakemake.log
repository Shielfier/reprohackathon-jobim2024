MissingOutputException in rule index in file /home/sebastien/Bureau/reprohackathon-jobim2024/snakemake/Snakefile, line 14:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/home/sebastien/Bureau/toy_examples/index/yeast.1.bt2
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
